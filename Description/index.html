        <h4>Artist: Manuel Solano</h4>
        <h4>Year: 2017</h4>
        <h4>Medium: Acrylic on canvas</h4>
        <h4>Courtesy: Manuel Solano</h4>
        <p>
            Full Label Text: Bridging personal and cultural memories, Manuel Solano’s work proposes that the power of painting might manifest untethered from sight. The artist’s humorous, poignant scenes are inspired by personal reminiscences and mainstream pop culture from before 2014, the year Solano became legally blind as the result of negligent and inadequate HIV/AIDS treatment. Solano’s work expands into territories of longing and desire, gender construction, trans* identity, cover songs, music videos, movies, disability, and moments recreated from their “mind’s eye.” Artist Bio: In contrast to his past work—videos and internet-based art rooted in issues of over sharing and the manipulation of identity—Manuel Solano has worked almost exclusively with paint on paper in recent years. After losing his sight to an HIV-related bacterial infection, Solano began painting as a distraction from the pain, allowing the activity to become a form of release and temporary escape. Solano’s paintings are centered on his identity as a transgender person living with HIV, often addressing memories, identity, and the artist’s past as a means of making sense of the present. His text-based works and portraits, which are made with inexpensive paints and paper, reflect the necessity of his art making and contain references with deep personal meanings. Words from the Artist: “I work using ubiquitous references and pop culture imagery to make commentaries about my experiences and self. Early in 2014 I became blind as a result of an HIV-related infection. Before going blind, I was one of the best painters I could think of, certainly the best one I personally knew. Now, I’m not so sure. My work is still very much, however, referential and intimate; queer and nostalgic; silly and provocative; exuberant and engaging.
